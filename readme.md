## About the Author

Constance C. Greene was born in New York City and grew in a family of writers. Her parents and grandfather wrote for newspapers and began writing when she was eight or nine. She attended Skidmore College and then reported for the Associated Press before she married and raised five children, who gave her plenty of ideas.

Greene has written twenty-five books for children and one adult novel, and says she writes to amuse and entertain. She loves reading, spying on people and eavesdropping, and she still writes from her home by the sea in Connecticut.

## About the Website

&ldquo;Connie&rdquo; Greene, my mother&rsquo;s mother, is now 91 years old and still writing. When I found out her books were being released in eBook format for the first time, I decided she deserved a website to catalog her significant body of work, and give a brand new audience access to the digital versions of her books. I take significant pleasure in knowing she still writes using only an electric typewriter, despite my numerous attempts to get her hands on a fully-capable computer.

At this point, I think she can write however she wants. Here&rsquo;s to you, Gran.
