Both are surprised when her lessons end up showing them what it really means to be a tough guy.</p>

                    <p>I am the most popular girl in the entire tenth grade. I am long and lean and sinuous&#8230;Fifteen year old Grace lies a lot. She&#8217;s lonely, unpopular, and is saving up for an operation to reduce the size of her 38D breasts. After surviving a cruel prank, and then encountering a puzzling coincidence, she manages to emerge stronger and ready to change her life.</p>

                    <p>All Oliver really wants is to be a hero&#8212;but it&#8217;s not that easy being heroic. Held hostage in a stick-up, stuck in a tree, sprayed by a skunk&#8212;it seems as if Oliver will never achieve hero status. Then his dog chokes on a chicken bone, and Oliver&#8217;s big moment arrives.</p>

                        Nora: Maybe a Ghost Story
                    </a></h2>
                    <p>It&#8217;s been three years since Nora and Patsy&#8217;s mother died, and though they&#8217;re eager for him to be happy again, they dread the thought of their father remarrying. Suddenly Nora begins to feel her mother&#8217;s gentle touch, hear her laughter and get comfort from her spiritual presence. Maybe it&#8217;s time for their father to make his own choices, and for both sisters to move forward with their own lives.</p>

                        <p>From the first page, masterly comic timing and sharp, witty observations (from a protagonist who could be a cousin to the narrator of the author&#8217;s Al books) firmly establish that the reader had entered Greene territory.</p>
